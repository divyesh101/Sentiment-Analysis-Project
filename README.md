# Sentiment Analysis using NLTK and VADER

This project implements sentiment analysis using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) and VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner). It analyzes the sentiment of text input, providing insights into whether the sentiment expressed is positive, negative, or neutral. Key features include:

Custom Lexicon Extension: Enhances sentiment analysis accuracy with custom word scores.
Text Preprocessing: Converts text to lowercase, removes punctuation, and filters out stopwords for streamlined analysis.
Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging: Focuses on adjectives, adverbs, and nouns to capture nuanced sentiment.
Sentiment Visualization: Utilizes Matplotlib to graphically represent sentiment scores of sentences, aiding in visual interpretation.
This project is ideal for understanding sentiment trends in textual data and can be adapted for various applications such as social media sentiment analysis, customer feedback analysis, and more.
